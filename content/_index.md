### About

Hi, I'm Phelipe. Here's a little about me:

I graduated in economics, fell in love with econometrics along the way, learned
how building software can be fun and now and I'm a hobbyst programmer
who wish to break into the industry someday.

Most of my experience has been with Python, R, VBA and Excel for data analytics
and academic stuff, but lately I've been flerting with web development,
learning CSS, JavaScript and databases.

I also got really interested in Unix, Vim and the terminal in general.

### Projects summary

I have some Python projects, mostly to integrate
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org "Pandas Python library") with web APIs, such
as [reportforce](https://github.com/phelipetls/reportforce "Reportforce Python
library"), [seriesbr](https://github.com/phelipetls/seriesbr "Python library")
and [mapsbr](https://github.com/phelipetls/mapsbr "Python library").

My first web project was this
[minesweeper](https://some-minesweeper.herokuapp.com "Minesweeper Game")
implementation.
