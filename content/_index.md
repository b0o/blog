# About

I have a background in Economics (mostly Econometrics), which got me interested
in R and programming later, in general. Today I wish to break into the industry
somehow.

Most of my experience has been with Python, R and VBA for data analytics and
academic stuff, but I've developing an interest in web development too lately,
so I'm studying CSS, JavaScript, databases etc.

Also, this site is built with a framework for static site generator called Hugo.
