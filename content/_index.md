My name is Phelipe Teles, I'm 24 years old and I live in Rio.

I studied Economics but ended more interested in software development. I got
into programming due to Econometrics, which led me to learn R and Python.

Although I still like statistics very much, I've found myself enjoying building
software in general and I expect someday to work professionally with it.

I'm interested in web development and data science and I mostly using Python
and JavaScript.
