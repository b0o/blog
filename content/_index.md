Hi, my name is Phelipe Teles, I have a background in Economics but am currently
most interested in software development.

I really got into programming because of Econometrics, which led me to learn R
and Python, but since then this has expanded beyond the statistical domain.

Most of my experience has been with Python, R, VBA and Power BI for academic
and data analysis taks, but I've been learning about web development lately
too.

Check out my [projects](/projects) and [blog](/posts) to know more about me.
