I have a background in Economics (mostly Econometrics), which got me interested
in R and showed me how programming in general can be fun. I have studied it
since then on my free time.

Most of my experience has been with Python, R and VBA for data analytics and
academic stuff, but I've been developing an interest in web development lately.

Also, this site is built with a framework for static site generator called Hugo.
