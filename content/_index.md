Hi, I'm a front-end developer, currently working on web and mobile apps with
React, React Native, JavaScript and TypeScript.

I graduated in Economics but my interest in Econometrics and Statistics got me
into software development, which studied on the side until I was able
to get a job, and I definitely don't pretend to switch career again.

This site is a project to experiment on web technologies, [write about myself,
what I learn and what I'm building](/posts), and [share my side
projects](/projects).
