Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm a front-end web developer who lives in Rio, Brazil.

I enjoy writing about web development, command-line tools, Linux -- programming
in general.

I've been building user interfaces with React professionally for a few years
now.

I graduated in Economics, but decided to work with software after I found
myself more interested by the programming part of Econometrics and Statistics.
