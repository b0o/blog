Hi, my name is Phelipe, I'm 24 years old, living in Rio.

I studied Economics but ended more interested in software development. I got
into programming due to Econometrics, which led me to learn R and Python.

Although I still like statistics very much, I've found myself more interested
in computer science side of things. Now I wanna break into the industry someday.

I'm interested in web development and data science and I mostly using Python
and JavaScript.
