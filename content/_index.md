### About

I have a background in Economics (mostly Econometrics), which got me interested
in programming so much to the point that I wish I could break into the industry
someday.

Most of my experience has been with Python, R and VBA for data analytics and
academic stuff, but I've developing an interest in web development so I'm
studying CSS, JavaScript, databases etc.
