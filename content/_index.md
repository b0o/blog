# About

I'm a software developer from Brazil, Rio.

I came from an Economics background, but am currently working as a front-end web
developer.

Lately, I'm mostly busy building user interfaces with React, JavaScript and
TypeScript. I'm also interested in learning about web APIs, software
architecture and infrastructure.

In my free time, I like to write Python and Lua code.
