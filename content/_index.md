I'm a front-end developer from Brazil, currently working  at
[Mutual](https://mutual.club/), building web and mobile apps with React, React
Native, JavaScript and TypeScript.

In this blog, you can expect me to share stuff about web development and my
development environment, among other things.

I used to be into data science and Econometrics, and most of my projects were
built to help me manipulate and visualize data.
