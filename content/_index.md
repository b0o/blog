Hi, my name is Phelipe, this is a place to share my interests and stuff I do.

I studied Economics but ended more interested in software development and I aim
to work with it professionally someday.

I got into programming due to Econometrics, which first led me to learn R and
Python, but this was gradually expanding beyond the statistics.

Most of my experience has been with Python, R and VBA for academic and data
analysis tasks, but lately I've been learning about web development too.
