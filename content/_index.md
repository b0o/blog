# About

Hi, I'm a software developer based in Brazil, Rio.

I am currently working as a front-end developer building mobile and web user
interfaces with React, JavaScript and TypeScript.

I'm also interested in learning how things work on the back-end, but my
experience with it is limited.

Other than that, I like Python, Lua and Linux.
