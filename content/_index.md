Hi, my name is Phelipe, I'm a software developer from Brazil, Rio.

I came from an Economics background, but am currently working as a front-end
web developer.

Lately, I'm mostly concerned in getting better at building user interfaces with
React, JavaScript and TypeScript. But I also like to learn about web APIs and
software infrastructure.

Sometimes I also write some Python and Lua code.
