Hi, my name is Phelipe Teles, I have a background in Economics but ended being
more interested in software development.

I got into programming due to Econometrics, which first led me to learn R
and Python, but this was gradually expanding beyond the statistical domain.

Most of my experience has been with Python, R and VBA for academic and data
analysis tasks, but lately I've been learning about web development too.
