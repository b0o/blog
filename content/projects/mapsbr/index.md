Provides an interface to get geospatial data from an [IBGE
API](https://servicodados.ibge.gov.br/api/docs/malhas?versao=2) or an ArcGIS
server in the [`geopandas`](https://geopandas.org/) format.

This was my second Python project and it was inspired by the
[geobr](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr) package for R.
