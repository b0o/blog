# A blog where I share my interests and thoughts

It is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and styled with
[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

I didn't intend to make it flashy, because I'm really not that great at that.
Instead, my focus was to make it legible, convenient and performant.

When it comes to performance, it was almost effortless to get something
satisfying. I made sure to follow good practices and get good measures in
[Google's Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/).
