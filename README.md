# phelipetls.github.io

Source code for phelipetls.github.io, my personal website and blog. It is built
with Hugo, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript and hosted on GitHub Pages.

I use [umami](https://umami.is/docs/track-events) for analytics, self-hosted on
[Railway](railway.app/). And [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/) for comments.

I'm thankful to all of these projects.
