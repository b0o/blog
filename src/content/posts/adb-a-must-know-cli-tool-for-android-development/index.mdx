[`adb`](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) is a CLI that
lets you control your Android device from your computer. In this post I want to
share its features that made me enjoy more mobile development.

# Initial Setup

First, you'll need to connect your device to your computer, either [through
USB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#Enabling) or [purely
via
Wi-Fi](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#connect-to-a-device-over-wi-fi-android-11+)
(*if you're on Android 11+*), but it's also possible to use `adb` over Wi-Fi on
Android 10 or lower if you follow some [initial
steps](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#wireless) while
connected over USB.

If everything works correctly, by running `adb devices` you should see
something like this:

```shell
$ adb devices

List of devices attached
emulator-5554	device
0035714150	device
```

# Record screen with `adb shell screenrecord`

To record your screen, it's as simple as running `adb shell screenrecord
/sdcard/video.mp4`. After you're done, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.
Run `adb pull /sdcard/video.mp4 ~/Videos/video.mp4` to get the video into your
computer.

It's also useful to know some of the [command line
options](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#screenrecord),
my favorite ones being to limit the video size with `--size` and recording time
with `--time-limit`.

For example, I typically run `adb shell screenrecord --size 320x568
--time-limit=120 /sdcard/video.mp4`.

# Capture screen with `adb shell screencap`

This is straightforward, it just captures the screen with `adb shell screencap
/sdcard/img.png`, then getit locally with `adb pull /sdcard/img.png
~/Images/img.png`.

# Debugging with `adb logcat`

This has proved useful to me so many times. In the context of React Native
development, this is usually less useful in debug builds. But in release builds
it's sometimes the only way to debug when something wrong happens.

For example, when an app crashes or some SDK call is not working, you'll
probably be able to see why with `adb logcat`.

The downside is that the output can be overwhelming, since it's a huge wall of
text that is growing constantly. So it pays off to know how to filter it, e.g.
if I wanted to see only logs tagged with `Sentry`, `ReactNative` and
`ReactNativeJS` at any priority level:

```shell
$ adb logcat Sentry:* ReactNative:* ReactNativeJS:* *:S
```

The official Google
[documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat#filteringOutput)
explains nicely how this works.

# Networking with `adb reverse`

Imagine you want to see your [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) files in a
mobile web browser. If you go to `localhost:6006` in your computer's browser,
it works, but nothing shows up in your mobile device's browser, since no
process is bound to port `6060` there.

You can solve this problem by running `adb reverse tcp:6006 tcp:6006`. Now your
mobile device will have access to the server running on your computer.

An example from React Native is the Metro bundler, that usually serves the
bundled JS of your app at port `8081`, so we need to run `adb reverse tcp:8081
tcp:8081` to make the server available in your mobile device. This is usually
done under the hood when we run `npx react-native run-android`, but if the
device can't find the JS bundle or is stuck loading it we usually need to run
it again.

There's also `adb forward`, in case you need to make a web server running on
your phone also available in your computer.

# Start/kill apps

You can start and kill an app with the `adb shell am`, in which `am` stands for
[*Activity Manager*](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#am).

Given the app's package name, you can start it with:

```shell
$ adb shell am start -n com.company.app/.MainActivity
```

And kill it with:

```shell
$ adb shell am force-stop com.company.app
```

You can also open a URL, this is specially useful to test deep links:

```shell
$ adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d company://Screen
```

# Install/uninstall apps

You can install an `.apk` file with `adb install app.apk`.

And uninstall it with `adb uninstall com.company.app`.

This is usually how I do it, but there's also the `pm` command, which stands
for [Package
Manager](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#pm), that is a
more powerful interface to manage apps. Apart from enabling you to install and
uninstall apps, you can also clear data, grant/revoke permissions etc.
