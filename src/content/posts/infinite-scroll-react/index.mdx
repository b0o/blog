Infinite scroll is a common UX that web developers need to be comfortable
implementing. In this post, we'll see how to implement this experience using
standard web APIs such as
[`IntersectionObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
and React hooks.

# Introduction to IntersectionObserver

This is a standard web API that, as the name suggests, let us observe when an
element in our web page intersects with another.

In practice, we are interested in observing, for example, when the last row of
a table becomes visible to the user -- when it "intersects" with the
"viewport".

In the example below, we make the element's background turn green when it
becomes visible:

<ReactIntersectionObserverExample client:visible />

We can extrapolate this example to build an infinite scroll experience -- the
major difference here would be what to do once the element comes into view:
instead of changing the element's color, we would trigger a network request
etc.

# Introducing `react-inteserction-observer` library

The code in the previous example is not as expressive as I'd like. I'm also
never quite 100% sure if I'm doing things correctly in `useEffect` -- is my
that all the code I need to write in clean up function? Is there any potential
memory leaks? I don't think there is but I'm not quite sure either.

Because of this, I prefer to use a library for this. It turns out there is an
library,
[`react-inteserction-observer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intersection-observer),
that lets you use the `IntersectionObserver` API in a idiomatic way in React.

Let's re-write the previous example using its `useInView` hook:

<ReactIntersectionObserverLibExample client:visible />

This code is more readable, idiomatic and I'm more confident with it -- I don't
have to worry about `useEffect` clean up functions and memory leaks.

## Comparison with other libraries

I also like that `react-inteserction-observer` is just a thin wrapper around
`IntersectionObserver`. It has a small API surface and it does not do much more
than the web standard API -- it just translate it into the React way of doing
things.

For comparison, some people may prefer to use a library like
[`react-infinite-scroll-component`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component)
or
[`react-infinite-scroller`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroller),
which I dislike because they fall into the God-like components -- a much
opinionated abstraction with customization done entirely by props.

# Implementing infinite scroll

## With loading indicator

If our UI has a loading indicator, like a spinner, we can just pass the `ref`
returned by `useInView` hook to it. The `onChange` callback will be executed
when the spinner gets into view to handle getting more items:

<InfiniteScrollExample client:visible />

## Without loading indicator

If our UI doesn't have a loading indicator, we can use the `ref` as a [callback
refs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common#ref-callback) and
call it with the last item in the list:

<InfiniteScrollWithCallbackRefsExample client:visible />
