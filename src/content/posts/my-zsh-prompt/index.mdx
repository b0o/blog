I've been happy with my Zsh prompt for some time now, it probably isn't worth
of a blog post but I did need to read the manual to come up with it so maybe it
is.

# Default

By default, it looks like this:

```
phelipe @ ~/dotfiles %
```

If we don't care about colors, the code for this would be

```sh title="~/.zshrc"
export PROMPT='%n @ %~ %#'
```

# With colors

<Image

  alt="A zsh shell session with the prompt showing 'phelipe @ ~/Projetos/blog %' but now with colors"
  src={ColoredPrompt}
/>

But we do care about colors, so let's do that.

To give text a foreground color we surround it with `%F{red}textf`. And,
similarly, to bold text we surround it with `%Btext%b`:

```sh title="~/.zshrc"
export PROMPT='\
%B%F{green}%n %b%f\
%B%F{yellow}@ %b%f\
%B%F{blue}%~ %b%f\
%B%F{black}%# %b%f\
'
```

manual.](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Prompt-Expansion.html#Visual-effects)

# Git integration

<Image

  src={GitPrompt}
/>

When on a git repository, an indicator with the branch name is shown:

```
phelipe @ ~/dotfiles (master) %
```

If the branch name is too long, it'll be truncated:

```
phelipe @ ~/dotfiles (the-quick-brown-fox-jumps-over-the-l…) %
```

This is achieved using a shell function called `__git_ps1`, which is part of
the Git project itself

<Warn>

To use `__git_ps1`, you'll need to source
[`git-prompt.sh`](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh)
shell script, that comes with every git installation, in your `.zshrc`. The
exact path to the script may vary per OS or Linux distribution, for instance I
have this in my `.zshrc`, which supports Ubuntu, Fedora and macOS (not sure if
there's a way to simplify it).

```sh title="~/.zshrc"
if [ -f /usr/lib/git-core/git-sh-prompt ]; then
  source /usr/lib/git-core/git-sh-prompt
elif [ -f /usr/share/git-core/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh ]; then
  source /usr/share/git-core/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh
elif [ -f /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/share/git-core/git-prompt.sh ]; then
  source /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/share/git-core/git-prompt.sh
fi
```

</Warn>

It also indicates if you're reverting, cherry-picking, rebasing, merging,
bisecting etc.

```
phelipe @ ~/dotfiles (master|REBASE 1/2) %
```

To display its output around parenthesis, we can pass a `printf`-like argument
to it: `__git_ps1 "(%s) "`.

And to truncate it at 40 characters, we use a Zsh built-in feature. We mark the
start of the truncation with `%40>…) >`, in which `40` is the maximum permitted
length and `…) ` is the truncation indicator. We mark the end of the truncated
text with `%<<`.

```sh title="~/.zshrc" {5}
export PROMPT='\
%B%F{green}%n %b%f\
%B%F{yellow}@ %b%f\
%B%F{blue}%~ %b%f\
%B%F{yellow}%40>…) >$(__git_ps1 "(%s) ")%<<%b%f\
%B%F{black}%# %b%f\
'
```

# Background jobs

<Image
  title=""
  alt="A zsh shell session with a prompt showing '*' as an indicator that there are jobs in the background"
  src={BackgroundJobPrompt}
/>

If there is a program running in the background, an asterisk is shown

```
phelipe @ ~/dotfiles (master) * %
```

This is useful because I often let Vim in the background with `<C-z>` to do
something in the terminal, and this serves as a reminder.

It works by using a Zsh built-in feature, a ternary-like expression with the
condition being if is there at least one background jobs:
`%(1j.<true>.<false>)`:

```sh title="~/.zshrc" {6}
export PROMPT='\
%B%F{green}%n %b%f\
%B%F{yellow}@ %b%f\
%B%F{blue}%~ %b%f\
%B%F{yellow}%40>…) >$(__git_ps1 "(%s) ")%<<%b%f\
%B%F{green}%(1j.* .)%b%f\
%B%F{black}%# %b%f\
'
```

[You can learn more about this conditional logic in Zsh prompt
in the their manual.](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Prompt-Expansion.html#Conditional-Substrings-in-Prompts)

# Error indicator

<Image
  title=""
  alt="A zsh shell session with a prompt with the '%' text in red because the last command execute was 'false'"
  src={ErrorPrompt}
/>

Finally, the `%` symbol turns red if the last program executed exited with an
error (a non-zero exit code).

To do this, we use the same ternary expression but using `?` as the condition,
which by default will be `true` if the exit status of the last command was `0`:

```sh title="~/.zshrc" {7}
export PROMPT='\
%B%F{green}%n %b%f\
%B%F{yellow}@ %b%f\
%B%F{blue}%~ %b%f\
%B%F{yellow}%40>…) >$(__git_ps1 "(%s) ")%<<%b%f\
%B%F{green}%(1j.* .)%b%f\
%B%F{%(?.black.red)}%# %b%f\
'
```
